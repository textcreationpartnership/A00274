         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yea and in this place miſreport vs out cauſe is vttered in theſe wordes: leſt they in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing anye of theſe things, ſhould geue occaſion to the heathen, to thinke that the god of heuen a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Earthe, had anie pleaſur in theſe things: or ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de of the vſe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his true ſeruis. and this is our onely reaſon wich well followith of yours: God willed ſay yow, that all the Cananites Ceremonies ſhold be deſtroyed: leſt his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by vſing ſuch Ceremonies, ſhold be ſnared ergo, as wee ſaye, god by ſo doing ſhewed he had no nede of ſuch Ceremonies.

               <p>The bondes and limittes whiche you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point for true obedrence of ſubiectes to their princes, are very narrowe &amp; daungerous. For oftentimes the Subiect ought to obey in thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges not forbidden by God, and commanded by lawe, though he do not plainly perceiue either for what good end they are required, of to what ende they will come: as daily experience in common wealthes do ſhewe.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1794:42"/>much as the Prince and councell knoweth and intendeth: or els you will ſet the ſubiect at his choyſe.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, here is perilous auctoritie graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to euery ſubiect, to determine vpon the Princes lawes, proclamations and ordinaunces that when they ſhall ſee them (many tymes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theruayes then they are in deede) vnprofitable then ſhall they, nay they muſt not do and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhe the ſame. If you reſtrayne this to matters Ecclefiaſticall, you helpe your ſelues neuer awhyt: For euery Miniſter there hath not full power to make and abrogate Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall lawes, nor yet knowledge well to iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of them.</p>
               <p>This is therfore ſcarſe to geue example of true obedience to God and man. For in not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being man in ſuch thinges indifferent, whoſe vſe you can not ſhew nowe to be wicked, you obey not God, whoſe miniſter man is.

               <p>As touching Chriſtian libertie, the fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thfull man muſt knowe, that it is altogether ſpirituall, and parteyneth only to the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, whiche muſt be pacified co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the lawe of God, and nerte well ſtayed in thinges indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. This libertie conſiſteth herein, not to be holden &amp; tyed with any religion in externall things: but that yt may be lawfull before God to vſe them or omit them, as occaſion ſhall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue. This perſwaſion a godly man muſt alwayes
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1794:43"/>retaine &amp; kepe ſafe in his minde: but when he commeth to thee vſe &amp; action of them, then muſt he moderate and qualifie his libertie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to charitie towarde his neighbour, and obedience to his Prince. So though by this knowledge his minde and conſcience is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes free:
<note place="margin">Caluin</note> yee his doing is as it were tied or limitted by lawe or loue. Hereupon a wel learned man ſaith: ¶ It is ſufficient in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an libertie to vnderſtand, that before God it is no matter, what meates, or what clothes thou vſe,

               <p>Nowe folovveth ſomevvhat that ſeemeth to touche the Cleargie, that is: That the Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of Rauenna (as you report) writte to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolus Caluus, that they ſhoulde not differ from the people in apparell, but doctrine. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fyrſt (yfyou wyll) let theſe wordes be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the firſt auctour therof, that is, to Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinus Biſhop of Rome, as you partly graunt, and then conſider nowe they furthet your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>Celeſtinus, about the yere of our Lorde 430. writte to the Biſhops of Fraunce, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt certaine that brought in vpon ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Nouitatem veſtium contra morem Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticum, Newe kinde of apparell, contrary to the Eccleſiaſticall maner, folowing the outwar de letter of the Scripture, that is, they woulde be: Amicti pallio, &amp; lumbos praecincti: Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a cloke, and girte about their loines. which thinges becauſe you ſpied there, you lefte out theſe wordes betwixte your two ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences alleaged: Nam ſi ſtudere incipiamus nouitati, traditum nobis a patribus ordinem calcabimus, vt locum ſuperuacuis ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus faciamus: For yf we begin to ſtudie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon noueltie, we ſhall treade vnder foote the order deliuered vnto vs from our fathers, and ſo make rowme for ſuperfluous ſuperſtitions.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1794:50"/>Nowe yf you will ſet together all theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtaunces, you ſhall perceiue all to make againſt you.</p>
               <p>Firſt. Celeſtinus meaning is of them that would ſerue God rather in garmentes then with puritie of hart. Then he ſpeaketh againſt thoſe that comming out of the Laitie, will vſe ſtill lay apparell. Laſt of all, againſt thoſe that ſeke innouations in ſuche matters, contrarie to loug preſcribed vſage and order. Reade his wordes in his Epiſtle, and you ſhall not denie this.</p>
               <p>If it pleaſe you to vrge the wordes, that we are to be diſcerned from the people nor by apparell, but by doctaine, you will remember that here is ſuch a compariſon as this: Non mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit me Chriſtus baptizare, ſed Euangelizare: Chriſt hath not ſent me to baptiſe, but to prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che the Goſpell: and yet Paule baptiſed.

<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor</hi> 11:</note> but chiefely it woulde be donne by doctrine and puritie of life.</p>
               <p>Why you fled to father theſe wordes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Celeſtinus, but rather to haue them appeare to be the Cleargies of Rauenna, which was 400. yeres after Celeſtinus was dead: ſome may thinke that you feared to put men in min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, that order in outwarde apparell was ſo auncient: or that you woulde haue no helpe at the Popes hande: or that you well knewe that the place made altogether againſt you.</p>

               <p>We are neither ignorant nor vnwilling to confeſſe that theſe wordes of the Church of

For Papiſtes and Dro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kerds are not depriued yf they receyue the gat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes. Secondlie he ſpeaketh of them that came out of the layetie, and will vſe ſtill lay ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>parell. How proue you that, it ſemeth other wiſe by his wordes. Dicimus quoſdam Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni ſacerdotes ſuperſtitioſo potius cultu inſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re quam mentis vel fidei puritati. We haue le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arned that certaine of the Lordes Prieſts, gaue hede raither to ſuperſtitious apparell, then to puritie of the mynde or faith. Myght he not thinke you, ſay ſo to manye engliſh Prieſts? He ſpeakith of Prieſts that are alredie, not of lay men coming to be Prieſtes. The text is plaine a gainſt yow: Non diſcernendi ſumus a plebe. Theſe ſuperſtitious preiſtes wold not haue lay apparell as yow ſay: But be diſcerned from the laye ſort, but Celeſtinus forbiddith. This ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might be wel one of M. hardingsgeſſis: Laſt of all he ſpekith of them which ſeke innoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, contrarie, to thold order, but this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uith not that they had an old orders for diſtinct
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1794:51"/>apparell of prieſts from lay men: elſe he wold haue ſaid, wee are ſufficientlie diſtinct allredy in apparell from the Layitie: let vs nowe bee deſerned by doctrine: but he ſaith wee muſt be diſcernid by doctrin and not by garments, by conuerſation, not by apparell, by purety of mynd, not by attire:</p>
               <p>But theſe wordes yow at loth: to haue vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſaying, they are ſpoken in a comparaiſon lyke the wordes of ſainct Paul: Chriſt ſent me, not to baptiſe but to preach, that is raither to preach then to baptiſe: A proper ſhifte at a pyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che, you checke vs after your maner for lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing out theſe wordes: Nam ſi ſtudere &amp;c: but yf you wolde haue put in theſe words that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low next after, all men ſholde haue perceyued that your ſlender ſhifte can not ſtand, Rudeser go fideliu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mentes, ad talia non debemus induce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re, docendi enim potius ſunt quam illudendi, nec imponendum eſt eorum oculis, ſed menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus infundenda praecepta: that is. therfore:</p>
               <p>We ought not to induce the vnſkilfull myndes of the faithfull to ſuch thinges, for they muſt raither be taught then mocked, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt we deceiue their eyes, but pour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes into their myndes.</p>
               <p>Celeſtinus plainlie denieth that the vnle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arned myndes of the faithfull ſhold be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued wyth ſuche thinges, counting it but a moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and deceauing of theire ieis.</p>

For though it chaunce ſo oftentimes, that many thinges are to be taught of them ſelues indifferent: yet in your example it ſhall not be lawefull for you to vſe them before your paroeces as you liſt. Meete is it that Chriſtian people heare diuers times of the freedome of conſcience, in meates, places, times, and dayes: and yet neither yow nor they ought to diſturbe politicall order lawfully taken.</p>
